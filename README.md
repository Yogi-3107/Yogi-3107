# Hi there! and Welcome..

I'm [__Yogesh Sharma__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogesh-sharma-953802222/), a graduate in BE - _Electronics and Communication_ and currently pursuing a master's degree in _VLSI Design_. I'm a VLSI enthusiast, always looking into newly proposed advancements in the field of new _MOSFET Technology_, updated _EDA tools_, new _fabrication techniques_ and so on. I aspire to become a VLSI Engineer and also possess some skills to realise this aspiration.
